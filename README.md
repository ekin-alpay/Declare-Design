##Declare Design Project: 

In this project I identify an experimental research design using the `DeclareDesign` package on R. This package allows users to declare and diagnose research designs to improve their quality and transparency.

This is a part of my final project for PS531-Quantitative Methods at UIUC 2022 Spring.
